Because computational biophysics attracts students from many different backgrounds and with different levels of resources, teaching the subject can be challenging. One strategy to teach diverse learners is with interactive multimedia material that promotes self-paced, active learning. We have created a hands-on education strategy with a set of fifteen modules that teach topics in biomolecular structure and design, from fundamentals of conformational sampling and energy evaluation to applications like protein docking, antibody design, and RNA structure prediction. Our modules are based on PyRosetta, a Python library that encapsulates all computational modules and methods in the Rosetta software package. The workshop-style modules are implemented as Jupyter Notebooks that can be executed in the Google Colaboratory, allowing learners access with just a web browser. The digital format of Jupyter Notebooks allows us to embed images, molecular visualization movies, and interactive coding exercises. This multimodal approach may better reach students from different disciplines and experience levels as well as attract more researchers from smaller labs and cognate backgrounds to leverage PyRosetta in their science and engineering research.

High performance computing cluster integration allows these benchmarks to run continuously and automatically. Detailed protocol captures are useful for developers and users of Rosetta and other macromolecular modeling tools.

The clinical success of thalidomide analogues demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of drug-induced degradation of transcription factors and other cancer targets, but a substantial subset of proteins are resistant to targeted degradation using existing approaches. Here we report an alternative mechanism of targeted protein degradation, in which a small molecule induces the highly specific, reversible polymerization of a target protein, followed by its sequestration into cellular foci and subsequent degradation. BI-3802 is a small molecule that binds to the Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-à-brac (BTB) domain of the oncogenic transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and leads to the proteasomal degradation of BCL6. We use cryo-electron microscopy to reveal how the solvent-exposed moiety of a BCL6-binding molecule contributes to a composite ligand–protein surface that engages BCL6 homodimers to form a supramolecular structure. Drug-induced formation of BCL6 filaments facilitates ubiquitination by the SIAH1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Our findings demonstrate that a small molecule such as BI-3802 can induce polymerization coupled to highly specific protein degradation, which in the case of BCL6 leads to increased pharmacological activity compared to the effects induced by other BCL6 inhibitors. These findings open new avenues for the development of therapeutic agents and synthetic biology.","tags":["Protein Degradation"],"title":"Small molecule-induced polymerization triggers degradation of BCL6","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roy Burman SS","Jeliazkov JR","Labonte JW","Nance ML","Lubin JH","Biswas N \u0026 Gray JJ"],"categories":["Research Article"],"content":"","date":1596304484,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596304484,"objectID":"2c8de1362dba67638bf8f6a633781f90","permalink":"https://ssrb19.github.io/publication/2020_proteins/","publishdate":"2020-07-20T16:54:09-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_proteins/","section":"publication","summary":"Critical Assessment of PRediction of Interactions (CAPRI) rounds 37 through 45 introduced larger complexes, new macromolecules, and multistage assemblies. For these rounds, we used and expanded docking methods in Rosetta to model 23 target complexes.

Notably, for targets T110 and T136, we achieved the closest prediction of any CAPRI participant. We created several innovative approaches during these rounds. Since round 39 (target 122), we have used the new RosettaDock 4.0, which has a revamped coarse‐grained energy function and the ability to perform conformer selection during docking with hundreds of pregenerated protein backbones. Ten of the complexes had some degree of symmetry in their interactions, so we tested Rosetta SymDock, realized its shortcomings, and developed the next‐generation symmetric docking protocol, SymDock2, which includes docking of multiple backbones and induced‐fit refinement. Since the last CAPRI assessment, we also developed methods for modeling and designing carbohydrates in Rosetta, and we used them to successfully model oligosaccharide‐protein complexes in round 41. Although the results were broadly encouraging, they also highlighted the pressing need to invest in (a) flexible docking algorithms with the ability to model loop and linker motions and in (b) new sampling and scoring methods for oligosaccharide‐protein interactions.","tags":["CAPRI","Rosetta"],"title":"Novel sampling strategies and a coarse-grained score function for docking homomers, flexible heteromers, and oligosaccharides using Rosetta in CAPRI Rounds 37–45","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koehler Leman J","Weitzner BD","Lewis SM","Adolf-Bryfogle J","Alam N","Alford RF","Aprahamian M","Baker D","Barlow KA","Barth P","Basanta B","Bender BJ","Blacklock K","Bonet J","Boyken S","Bradley P","Bystroff C","Conway P","Cooper S","Correia BE","Coventry B","Das R","De Jong RM","DiMaio F","Dsilva L","Dunbrack R","Ford A","Frenz B","Fu DY","Geniesse C","Goldschmidt L","Gowthaman R","Gray JJ","Gront D","Guffy S","Horowitz S","Huang P-S","Huber T","Jacobs TM","Jeliazkov JR","Johnson DK","Kappel K","Karanicolas J","Khakzad H","Khar KR","Khare SD","Khatib Firas","Khramushin A","King IC","Kleffner R","Koepnick B","Kortemme T","Kuenze G","Kuhlman B","Kuroda D","Labonte JW","Lai JK","Lapidoth G","Leaver- Fay A","Lindert S","Linsky T","London N","Lubin JH","Lyskov S","Maguire J","Malmström L","Marcos E","Marcu O","Marze NA","Meiler J","Moretti R","Mulligan VK","Nerli S","Norn C","Ó’Conchúir S","Ollikainen N","Ovchinnikov S","Pacella MS","Pan X","Park H","Pavlovicz RE","Pethe M","Pierce BG","Pilla KB","Raveh B","Renfrew PD","Roy Burman SS","Rubenstein A","Sauer MF","Scheck A","Schief W","Schueler-Furma O","Sedan Y","Sevy AM","Sgourakis NG","Shi L","Siegel J","Silva D-A","Smith S","Song Y","Stein A","Szegedy M","Teets FD","Thyme SB","Wang RY-R","Watkins A","Zimmerman L \u0026 Bonneau R"],"categories":["Review"],"content":"","date":1591033364,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591033364,"objectID":"669214de51af93060e02cab96fc65477","permalink":"https://ssrb19.github.io/publication/2020_natmethods/","publishdate":"2020-06-25T13:42:44-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_natmethods/","section":"publication","summary":"The Rosetta software for macromolecular modeling, docking and design is extensively used in laboratories worldwide.

The size of these complexes often makes them intractable to high-resolution structure determination experiments. Computational docking algorithms offer a promising alternative for modeling large complexes with arbitrary symmetry. Accuracy of existing algorithms, however, is limited by backbone inaccuracies when using homology-modeled monomers. Here, we present Rosetta SymDock2 with a broad search of symmetrical conformational space using a six-dimensional coarse-grained score function followed by an all-atom flexible-backbone refinement, which we demonstrate to be essential for physically realistic modeling of tightly packed complexes. In global docking of a benchmark set of complexes of different point symmetries—starting from homology-modeled monomers—we successfully dock (defined as predicting three near-native structures in the five top-scoring models) 17 out of 31 cyclic complexes and 3 out of 12 dihedral complexes.","tags":["Rosetta"],"title":"Flexible backbone assembly and refinement of symmetrical homomeric complexes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marze NA*","Roy Burman SS*","Sheffler W \u0026 Gray JJ"],"categories":["Research Article"],"content":"","date":1525110920,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525110920,"objectID":"7cc795860411e95210013dc885e784ae","permalink":"https://ssrb19.github.io/publication/2018_bioinformatics/","publishdate":"2020-06-25T13:55:20-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_bioinformatics/","section":"publication","summary":"Motivation: Binding-induced conformational changes challenge current computational docking algorithms by exponentially increasing the conformational space to be explored. To restrict this search to relevant space, some computational docking algorithms exploit the inherent flexibility of the protein monomers to simulate conformational selection from pre-generated ensembles. As the ensemble size expands with increased flexibility, these methods struggle with efficiency and high false positive rates. Results: Here, we develop and benchmark RosettaDock 4.0, which efficiently samples large conformational ensembles of flexible proteins and docks them using a novel, six-dimensional, coarse-grained score function. A strong discriminative ability allows an eight-fold higher enrichment of near-native candidate structures in the coarse-grained phase compared to RosettaDock 3.2. It adaptively samples 100 conformations each of the ligand and the receptor backbone while increasing computational time by only 20–80%. In local docking of a benchmark set of 88 proteins of varying degrees of flexibility, the expected success rate (defined as cases with ≥50% chance of achieving 3 near-native structures in the 5 top-ranked ones) for blind predictions after resampling is 77% for rigid complexes, 49% for moderately flexible complexes and 31% for highly flexible complexes. These success rates on flexible complexes are a substantial step forward from all existing methods. Additionally, for highly flexible proteins, we demonstrate that when a suitable conformer generation method exists, the method successfully docks the complex.

Cell-based experiments demonstrate that corin exhibits a superior anti-proliferative profile against several melanoma lines and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma lines compared to its parent monofunctional inhibitors but is less toxic to melanocytes and keratinocytes. CoREST knockdown, gene expression, and ChIP studies suggest that corin’s favorable pharmacologic effects may rely on an intact CoREST complex.

We achieved acceptable or better quality models in three out of 11 targets. For the two α‐repeat protein–green fluorescent protein (αrep–GFP) complexes, we used a novel ellipsoidal partial‐global docking method (Ellipsoidal Dock) to generate models with 2.2 Å/1.5 Å interface RMSD, capturing 49%/42% of the native contacts, for the 7‐/5‐repeat αrep complexes. For the DNase–immunity protein complex, we used a new predictor of hydrogen‐bonding networks, HBNet with Bridging Waters, to place individual water models at the complex interface; models were generated with 1.8 Å interface RMSD and 12% native water contacts recovered. The targets for which RosettaDock failed to create an acceptable model were typically difficult in general, as six had no acceptable models submitted by any CAPRI predictor. The UCH‐L5–RPN13 and UCH‐L5–INO80G de‐ubiquitinating enzyme–inhibitor complexes comprised inhibitors undergoing significant structural changes upon binding, with the partners being highly interwoven in the docked complexes. Our failure to predict the nucleosome‐enzyme complex in Target 95 was largely due to tight constraints we placed on our model based on sparse biochemical data suggesting two specific cross‐interface interactions, preventing the correct structure from being sampled. While RosettaDock's three successes show that it is a state‐of‐the‐art docking method, the difficulties with highly flexible and multi‐domain complexes highlight the need for better flexible docking and domain‐assembly methods.","tags":["CAPRI"],"title":"Modeling oblong proteins and water-mediated interfaces with RosettaDock in CAPRI rounds 28–35","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lensink MF","Velankar S","Kryshtafovych A","Huang SY","Schneidman-Duhovny D","Sali A","Segura J","Fernandez- Fuentes N","Viswanath S","Elber R","Grudinin S","Popov P","Neveu E","Lee H","Baek M","Park S","Heo L","Rie Lee G","Seok C","Qin S","Zhou HX","Ritchie DW","Maigret B","Devignes MD","Ghoorah A","Torchala M","Chaleil RA","Bates PA","Ben-Zeev E","Eisenstein M","Negi SS","Weng Z","Vreven T","Pierce BG","Borrman TM","Yu J","Ochsenbein F","Guerois R","Vangone A","Rodrigues JP","van Zundert G","Nellen M","Xue L","Karaca E","Melquiond AS","Visscher K","Kastritis PL","Bonvin AM","Xu X","Qiu L","Yan C","Li J","Ma Z","Cheng J","Zou X","Shen Y","Peterson LX","Kim HR","Roy A","Han X","Esquivel-Rodriguez J","Kihara D","Yu X","Bruce NJ","Fuller JC","Wade RC","Anishchenko I","Kundrotas PJ","Vakser IA","Imai K","Yamada K","Oda T","Nakamura T","Tomii K","Pallara C","Romero-Durana M","Jiménez-García B","Moal IH","Férnandez-Recio J","Joung JY","Kim JY","Joo K","Lee J","Kozakov D","Vajda S","Mottarella S","Hall DR","Beglov D","Mamonov A","Xia B","Bohnuud T","Del Carpio CA","Ichiishi E","Marze N","Kuroda D","Roy Burman SS","Gray JJ","Chermak E","Cavallo L","Oliva R","Tovchigrechko A \u0026 Wodak","SJ"],"categories":["Research Article"],"content":"","date":1461866152,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461866152,"objectID":"edab2bcfd04257b049e89ca49bd2d612","permalink":"https://ssrb19.github.io/publication/2016_proteins/","publishdate":"2020-06-25T13:55:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_proteins/","section":"publication","summary":"We present the results for CAPRI Round 30, the first joint CASP‐CAPRI experiment, which brought together experts from the protein structure prediction and protein–protein docking communities. The Round comprised 25 targets from amongst those submitted for the CASP11 prediction experiment of 2014. The targets included mostly homodimers, a few homotetramers, and two heterodimers, and comprised protein chains that could readily be modeled using templates from the Protein Data Bank. On average 24 CAPRI groups and 7 CASP groups submitted docking predictions for each target, and 12 CAPRI groups per target participated in the CAPRI scoring experiment. In total more than 9500 models were assessed against the 3D structures of the corresponding target complexes. Results show that the prediction of homodimer assemblies by homology modeling techniques and docking calculations is quite successful for targets featuring large enough subunit interfaces to represent stable associations. Targets with ambiguous or inaccurate oligomeric state assignments, often featuring crystal contact‐sized interfaces, represented a confounding factor. For those, a much poorer prediction performance was achieved, while nonetheless often providing helpful clues on the correct oligomeric state of the protein. The prediction performance was very poor for genuine tetrameric targets, where the inaccuracy of the homology‐built subunit models and the smaller pair‐wise interfaces severely limited the ability to derive the correct assembly mode. Our analysis also shows that docking procedures tend to perform better than standard homology modeling techniques and that highly accurate models of the protein components are not always required to identify their association modes with acceptable accuracy.","tags":["CAPRI"],"title":"Prediction of homo- and hetero-protein complexes by ab-initio and template-based docking: a CASP-CAPRI experiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"https://ssrb19.github.io/home/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
